## WELCOME

Welcome to the re-purposed *Game Dev Club Fall 2016* repository.

This was likely one of the first repositories I had ever made on Github or Gitlab.
However, it was quite literally untouched for about 5 years.

I intend to "revive" the repository as the blueprint for a basic game made
using web design code (HTML, CSS, JS).
